= 🛠️ Creating a Workbench

== 🚀 Launch a Workbench

* Once the Data Connection and Pipeline Server are fully created, it's time to create your workbench! 🎉
* Go to **Data Science Projects**, select your previously created project (`{user}`), and click on **Create a workbench**

* Make sure it has the following characteristics:
** Choose a name for it, like: `My Workbench` 🌟
** Image Selection: `Minimal Python` or `Standard Data Science` 🐍
** Container Size: `Medium` 📦
** Accelerator: `NVIDIA-GPU` 💻
* That should look like:

* Add the created Data Connection by clicking on the Connections section and selecting **Attach existing connections**. Then, click **Attach** for the created **Minio - models** connection. 🔗

* You should not need to modify any other Workbench settings (such as Storage).
* Then, click on **Create Workbench** and wait for your workbench to be fully started. ⏳
* Once it is, click the **Open** link to connect to it! 🔗

== JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebooks 

[NOTE]
====
Workbenches utilize JupyterLab, an interactive development environment you'll access directly through your web browser. Think of JupyterLab as a workbench that's excellent for hands-on experimentation, which is especially useful in AI development.

Within JupyterLab, we'll be using Jupyter Notebooks. A Notebook is like an interactive document where you can:

* Write and execute Python code in small, manageable cells.
* Instantly see the output from your code.
* Easily modify code and vars and re-execute 
* Combine code with explanatory text (like this!), images, and charts, all in one place.
This combination makes Notebooks ideal for learning new concepts and testing ideas step-by-step.

.Quick interactive introduction to using and customizing your Workbench (recommended)

(This Interactive demo was recorded using a Virtual Machine Based Jupyter Lab but behaves in exactly the same way.)

== 🌟 Git-Clone the Common Repo

We will clone the content of our Git repo so that you can access all the materials created as part of our prototyping exercise. 📚

* Using the Git UI:
** Open the Git UI in Jupyter:
