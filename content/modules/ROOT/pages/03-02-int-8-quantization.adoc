= Weights and Activation Quantization (INT8)
include::_attributes.adoc[]


In this exercise, we will use a notebook to investigate how LLMs weights and activations can be quantized to **INT8** for memory savings and inference acceleration. This quantization method is particularly useful for:

- Reducing model size
- Maintaining good performance during inference

IMPORTANT: 🚨 The time for the workshop is limited. Please do only one of the INT versions (either **INT4** or **INT8**) and then **FP8**, which is fast as it does not need calibration data. You may choose to skip this section or section 3.1.


== Quantization Process

The quantization process involves the following steps:

1. **Load the Model**: Load the pre-trained LLM model.
2. **Prepare Calibration Dataset**: Prepare a dataset for calibration.
3. **Quantize the Model**: Convert the model weights and activations to **INT8** format.
   ** Using SmoothQuant and GPTQ
4. **Evaluate the Model**: Evaluate the quantized model's accuracy.

IMPORTANT: 🚨 After quantizing the model, the GPU memory may not be freed. You need to **restart the kernel** before evaluating the model to ensure you have enough GPU RAM available.

== Exercise: Quantize the Model with llm-compressor
Go to the workbench created in the previous section (Section 2). From the `neural-magic-workshop/lab-materials/03` folder, please open the notebook called `weight_activation_quantization.ipynb` and follow the instructions.

When done, you can close the notebook and head to the next page.

IMPORTANT: 🚨 Once you complete all the quantization exercises and you no longer need the workbench, ensure you **stop it** so that the associated GPU gets freed and can be utilized to serve the model.
