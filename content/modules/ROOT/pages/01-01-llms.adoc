= What Are Large Language Models (LLMs)?

A *Large Language Model (LLM)* is a type of *artificial intelligence (AI) model* designed to process and generate human-like text.

These models are trained on vast amounts of textual data and leverage *deep learning*, particularly *neural networks*, to understand, interpret, and generate natural language.

== How Do LLMs Work?
LLMs rely on *transformer-based architectures* (such as *GPT, BERT, or LLaMA*) to process text efficiently.

These models use:

* *Tokenization:* Breaking down text into smaller pieces (tokens) for analysis.
* *Context Understanding:* Using attention mechanisms to determine word relationships.
* *Training on Large Datasets:* Learning from diverse internet sources, books, articles, and code repositories.

== Common Applications of LLMs

* *Text Generation:* Writing articles, summaries, and creative content.
* *Chatbots & Virtual Assistants:* Powering AI-driven conversations (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude).
* *Code Generation & Debugging:* Assisting developers by writing and fixing code.
* *Machine Translation:* Translating text between languages.
* *Sentiment Analysis:* Understanding emotions in customer reviews, feedback, and social media.

== Examples of Popular LLMs

* *GPT-4, GPT-3.5 (OpenAI)* – General-purpose AI models for text generation.
* *Claude (Anthropic)* – Designed with a focus on helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty.
* *BERT (Google)* – Used for natural language understanding.
* *LLaMA (Meta AI)* – Open-weight language models.
* *PaLM (Google DeepMind)* – Advanced transformer-based LLM.

== Challenges & Considerations

* *Bias & Ethics:* LLMs can inherit biases from their training data.
* *Computational Cost:* Training and running LLMs require significant computing power.
* *Data Privacy:* Handling sensitive data responsibly is crucial in AI applications.
* *Hallucinations:* LLMs can generate plausible but incorrect information.
