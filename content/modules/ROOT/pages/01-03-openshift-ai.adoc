*Red Hat® OpenShift® AI* is a flexible and scalable *artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) platform* that enables enterprises to *build, deploy, and manage AI-powered applications* across *hybrid cloud environments*.

It is designed to streamline the AI/ML lifecycle, providing *trusted and consistent operations* from model development to production.

== Key Features
* *Hybrid Cloud AI/ML Platform:* Supports model training, deployment, and inference across public, private, and edge environments.
* *Open Source & Kubernetes-Based:* Built on *Red Hat OpenShift*, offering containerized workloads and scalability.
* *MLOps & Model Management:* Integrates *ML lifecycle tools*, ensuring efficient model experimentation, monitoring, and retraining.
* *Security & Compliance:* Provides enterprise-grade security, compliance, and governance for AI/ML workloads.
* *Accelerated AI Development:* Supports *deep learning frameworks* (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) and *popular MLOps tools* (e.g., Kubeflow, MLflow).

== Use Cases
* *AI-Powered Applications:* Deploy scalable AI services for *chatbots, automation, and analytics*.
* *Data Science & Model Training:* Manage *large-scale AI/ML workloads* efficiently.
* *Edge AI:* Bring AI/ML capabilities to edge computing environments with *real-time processing*.
* *Enterprise MLOps:* Enable *collaborative AI model development* with streamlined CI/CD workflows.
* *LLM Deployment:* Efficiently deploy and manage large language models in production environments.

== Why OpenShift AI?
* *End-to-End AI Lifecycle Management:* From *experimentation to production*, ensuring reproducibility and scalability.
* *Seamless Integration:* Works with existing AI/ML ecosystems, including *Jupyter Notebooks, Kubeflow, MLflow, and Open Data Hub*.
* *Enterprise-Grade Security:* Built-in security, governance, and access controls for AI/ML workloads.
* *Optimized for Performance:* Leverages *Red Hat OpenShift's container orchestration* for efficient model deployment.
* *Scalable Infrastructure:* Dynamically scales resources based on workload demands, optimizing cost and performance.

== Getting Started with OpenShift AI
* *Self-Managed:* Deploy on your own infrastructure with complete control.
